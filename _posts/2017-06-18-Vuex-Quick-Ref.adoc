## Store

- Instanciated with ```Vuex.Store(options)``` constructor
- Injected into child components as ```this.$store``` to enable easy access
- Properties of ```options``` object are described below.
    
### state

- ```state``` is the reactive data stored into a vuex ```store``` and very similar to the ```data``` property in options for component constructor.
- ```state``` variables are usually exposed as ```computed``` properties to enable easy access within components.
- ```mapState```
    - A utility function to mix & expose ```state``` variables as ```computed``` properties in components.
    - Imported as ```import { mapState } from 'vuex'```
    - Returns object, so it can be used to merge with local ```computed``` properties of components using [object spread](#) syntax,  i.e. ```...mapState({})```

### getters

- ```getters``` is for vuex ```store``` what ```computed``` is for components.
- ```getters``` are also exposed through ```computed``` properties to enable easy access within components.
- Signature of **getter** is ```getterName: function(state, getters) { /** ... */ }```
- Arguments can also be passed to getters by returning a function. This is particularly useful when querying an array in the store is required.
- ```mapGetters```
    - A utility function to mix & expose ```getters``` in ```computed``` within components.
    - Imported as ```import { mapGetters } from 'vuex'```
    - Returns object, so it can be used to merge with local ```computed``` properties of components using [object spread](#) syntax,  i.e. ```...mapGetters({})```

### mutations

- ```mutations``` is an object to define **mutator** methods in vuex ```store``` which are allowed & responsible to modify store's ```state```.
- It is not permissible to modify ```state``` directly in vuex stores, so **mutators** are needed.
- Signature of **mutator** is ```mutatorName: function(state, [payload]) { /** ... */ }```
- To invoke a **mutator**, you need to call ```store.commit(mutation, [payload])``` with its ```name``` and it's optional ```payload```.
- ```mutations``` must be synchronous.
- ```mapMutations```
    - A utility function to mix & expose ```mutations``` as component ```methods``` that invokes respective mutation via ```store.commit```.
    - Imported as ```import { mapMutations } from 'vuex'```
    - Returns object, so it can be used to merge with local ```methods``` option of components using [object spread](#) syntax,  i.e. ```...mapMutations({})```
    
### actions

- Actions are similar to mutations, the differences being that:
    - Instead of mutating the state, actions commit mutations.
    - Actions can contain arbitrary asynchronous operations.
- Action handlers receive a ```context``` object which exposes the same set of methods/properties on the ```store``` instance, so you can call ```context.commit``` to commit a mutation, or access the ```state``` and ```getters``` via ```context.state``` and ```context.getters``` respectively.
- Actions are triggered with the ```store.dispatch(actionName, payload)``` method.
